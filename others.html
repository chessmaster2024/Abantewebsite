      <p>My name is Freddierick T. Abante and I am 21 years old. I live in Pachoca Block 4. For me, I can see myself 6 years from now as an Information Systems Manager, because this is the goal of my life. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) degree, which I believe will provide me with the necessary knowledge and skills to achieve my career aspirations.</p> <p>As I continue my studies, I am focusing on developing my programming skills in Java and HTML, as well as learning about various aspects of information systems, including data management, network security, and software development. I am also interested in drawing and its applications in the field of Arts, which I believe will help me on my creativity in life.</p> <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and learn from others to improve my skills. I find that this habit helps me develop strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities, which are essential for success in my future career. Additionally, I am an avid player of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) and enjoy competing with friends and other players.</p> <p>My long-term goal is to become an Information Systems Manager, where I can utilize my technical skills and knowledge to lead teams and make strategic decisions that drive business growth and success. I believe that my passion for learning, combined with my strong work ethic and dedication to my goals, will help me achieve this ambition.</p><p>Let me know if you would like me to add any further details or make any changes.</p>
